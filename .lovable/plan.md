# Simplify Risk Analysis Drawer - COMPLETED ✓

Progressive disclosure design implemented. The drawer now shows:

1. **Unified Verdict Block** - Single card with headline + one-sentence rationale
2. **Primary CTA** - Immediately visible below verdict
3. **"View Details" Collapsible** - All secondary content (photo, detailed rationale, findings, chat link) hidden behind expansion

## Changes Made

- Merged verdict banner + rationale into single focused block
- Moved CTA to position #2 (immediately after verdict)
- Consolidated photo evidence, rationale breakdown, and findings into one collapsible
- Removed "What's Next" preview section entirely
- Moved chat button to inline link within details
- Reduced initial visible content from 7-8 sections to just 2 elements
